### ðŸ”¸ Artificial Intelligence: 
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, embodies the creation of intelligent systems that can simulate human thought processes. It encompasses tasks like problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language understanding. AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, empower us to develop systems that learn, adapt, and evolve.



### ðŸ”¸ Machine Learning:

1. Difference between AI and Machine Learning: While AI is the broader concept of creating machines capable of intelligent behavior, Machine Learning is a subset that involves enabling machines to learn from data without explicit programming.

2. Applications of Machine Learning: From recommendation systems to fraud detection, medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles, Machine Learning applications are vast and transformative.

3. Limitations of Machine Learning: While powerful, Machine Learning has limitations like dependency on data quality, lack of reasoning abilities, and susceptibility to bias.

4. Types of Machine Learning:

    - Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data, where the algorithm predicts outcomes based on examples.

    - Unsupervised Learning: Unearthing patterns and relationships in unlabeled data, often used for clustering and dimensionality reduction.

    - Reinforcement Learning: Training algorithms to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward, often used in robotics and gaming.

5. Comparisons between all Types: Understanding the unique characteristics and applications of each Machine Learning type is essential for informed decision-making.
